# Standard Operating Procedure: Assessment Development & Verification

**Document Control**
* **Procedure Name:** Assessment Development & Verification
* **Purpose:** To ensure constructive alignment between academic assessments, course syllabi, and learning outcomes via the Course Item Specification Table (CIST).

---

## 1. Objective
To ensure all academic assessments are constructively aligned with the course syllabus and learning outcomes through a strict verification framework using the Course Item Specification Table (CIST).

## 2. Definitions & Acronyms

| Term / Acronym | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CIST** | **Course Item Specification Table.** The controlling document that details the specific requirements, topics, and domain levels for each item in the assessment. |
| **HOP** | Head of Programme. |
| **HOD** | Head of Department. |
| **Coordinator** | The academic staff member responsible for the course oversight. |

### Learning Domains
* **Cognitive:** Mental skills (Knowledge).
* **Psychomotor:** Manual or physical skills (Skills).
* **Affective:** Growth in feelings or emotional areas (Attitude).

## 3. Workflow Roles

* **Creator**
    * *Description:* Lecturer or Coordinator responsible for drafting the content.
* **Reviewer**
    * *Description:* Peer or Coordinator responsible for quality assurance and compliance checking.
    * *Constraint:* If the Coordinator is also the Creator (e.g., sole instructor), the Reviewer **must be a Peer** to ensure independent verification.
* **Approver**
    * *Description:* HOP or HOD responsible for final endorsement.

## 4. Process Description

### Phase 1: Specification Design
**Objective:** To create the "blueprint" for the assessment.

1.  **Input:** Obtain the approved Course Syllabus.
2.  **Action:** The **Coordinator** extracts requirements from the syllabus to generate the CIST.
3.  **Requirements:**
    *   The CIST must explicitly categorize each assessment item by Learning Domain.
    *   Specific levels must be assigned (e.g., Cognitive C1-C6, Psychomotor P1-P5, Affective A1-A5).
4.  **Output:** Finalized CIST.

### Phase 2: Assessment Drafting
**Objective:** To generate assessment content based on the blueprint.

1.  **Input:** Finalized CIST.
2.  **Action:** The **Lecturer (or Coordinator)** drafts the assessment questions.
3.  **Constraints:**
    *   Every question must map directly to a specific entry in the CIST.
    *   Alignment must correspond to Topic, Difficulty, Marks, and Learning Domain.

### Phase 3: Compliance Review (Quality Assurance)
**Objective:** To audit the draft for accuracy and alignment.

1.  **Action:** The **Reviewer** audits the draft assessment.
2.  **Mandatory Constraint:** Independent verification is required. If the Coordinator created the draft, a Peer Reviewer must be assigned.
3.  **Verification Criteria:**
    *   **Domain Alignment:** Is the assessment method appropriate for the specified domain? (e.g., Practical test for Psychomotor vs. Written test for Cognitive).
    *   **Topic Mapping:** Does the specific Question match the topic specified in the CIST?
    *   **Level Check:** Is the taxonomy level (e.g., Recall vs. Analysis) appropriate for the student level?
    *   **Mark Allocation:** Is the mark allocation consistent with the CIST?
4.  **Decision:**
    *   *If Non-Compliant:* Return to **Creator** for amendments.
    *   *If Compliant:* Proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 4: Endorsement
**Objective:** Final approval for administration.

1.  **Action:** The **HOP/HOD** reviews the verified assessment package.
2.  **Outcome:** Signature and endorsement applied.
3.  **Result:** The assessment is approved to be printed and administered.
